I am very optimistic about the possibility of all of our existence and feel extremely indebted to do something very meaningful with our lives.

I believe that at the core of our technological advancements lies the years of research done by really brilliant minds in academia and is brought to fruition by some incredibly persistent and passionate entrepreneurs.

However I still believe that we need to optimise our academia and build more bridges between our academia and the industries, we need to make research papers more accessible and easily comprehensible for the masses and have more entrepreneurs who are willing to build around the work in academia.

Here's one tweet thread that I believe and relate to and working towards more than anything else.
